            <h1>Why you need to workout?</h1>
            <p>Whatever your age, there's strong scientific evidence that being physically active can help you lead a healthier and happier life. People who exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing many long-term (chronic) conditions, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and some cancers.</p><br>
            <p>Additional benefits of exercise: Improves the muscles' ability to pull oxygen out of the blood, reducing the need for the heart to pump more blood to the muscles. Reduces stress hormones that can put an extra burden on the heart. Works like a beta blocker to slow the heart rate and lower blood pressure.

            <h1>Jogging/Sprint</h1>
            <p>Start with 10 minutes of interval training and gradually increase to 30 minutes. Once you manage 30 minutes, gradually start to shorten the walking intervals until you can jog for half an hour without a break. How long will it take? Depending on your age, body weight and physical fitness, somewhere between 2-6 months.</p><br>
            <p>While jogging also helps burn calories, experts recommend sprinting as the best form of cardio for maintaining a healthy weight and staying in shape. Studies have shown you can burn 200 calories in just two and a half minutes of high impact sprinting.

            <p>You should try to skip for at least one minute each day to feel the benefits. Increase this as you start to feel less out of breath each day.</p>

            <p>Minimally processed foods are the best for sports and weight lifting nutrition. Lean protein, complex carbs and fiber are your best friends, especially if you're trying to lose weight.

            <h1>Water....Don't forget to drink enough water</h1>
            <p>You need to drink fluid during exercise to replace the fluids you lose when you sweat. That way, you'll reduce the risk of heat stress, maintain normal body function, and maintain performance levels. The general rule is: if you're sweating, you need to be drinking fluids.Water helps fuel your muscles, so drinking before, during and after exercise will boost your energy levels, and may help to prevent cramp.</p><br>
            <h2>What happens if you don't drink water during workout?<h2></h2>
            <p>In one hour of exercise the body can lose more than a quarter of its water. Dehydration leads to muscle fatigue and loss of coordination. Without an adequate supply of water the body will lack energy and muscles may cramp. So, drink before, during and after a workout.</p>
